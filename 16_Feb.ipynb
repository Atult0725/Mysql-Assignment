    "'''Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-A database is a collection of organized and structured data that is stored and managed on a computer. It is designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data. A database typically consists of tables or collections of data, which can be queried, updated, and modified using specific languages or tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases that have different structures, functionality, and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schemas. They use SQL to manipulate the data stored in the tables, which makes it easier to query and analyze data. SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require complex queries, high transaction volumes, and data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that store data in documents or key-value pairs. They do not have a fixed schema, which means that data can be added or modified without changing the structure of the database. NoSQL databases are well-suited for applications that require high scalability, flexibility, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structure: SQL databases use tables with fixed schemas, while NoSQL databases use documents or key-value pairs with flexible schemas.\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use SQL to query and manipulate data, while NoSQL databases use different query languages, such as MongoDB's query language.\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that you can increase their capacity by adding more resources to a single server. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, which means that you can add more servers to increase their capacity.\n",
    "Data Consistency: SQL databases provide strong data consistency, which means that data is always in a consistent state. NoSQL databases provide eventual consistency, which means that data consistency is not guaranteed in real-time, but eventually, all nodes will be consistent.\n",
    "Overall, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the amount of data, the type of queries, and the need for scalability and flexibility.\n",

    "'''Ans--DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define the structure of the database, including creating, modifying, and deleting database objects like tables, indexes, views, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the four primary DDL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create a new database object such as a table, view, index, or stored procedure. Here's an example of creating a new table in SQL\n",

    "   Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "   Age INT,\n",
    "   Salary INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "2.DROP: The DROP command is used to delete an existing database object such as a table, view, index, or stored procedure. Here's an example of deleting a table in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employee;\n",
    "\n",
    "3.ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, you can add, delete, or modify columns in a table using the ALTER command. Here's an example of adding a new column to an existing table in SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employee\n",
    "ADD Gender CHAR(1);\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key in sql.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL (Structured Query Language), a primary key and a foreign key are two types of constraints that help to establish a relationship between two or more tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a unique identifier for a table, which means that it must have a distinct value for each row of the table. It can be a single column or a combination of columns, but it must be unique and not null. The primary key is used to enforce data integrity, ensure data consistency, and to establish relationships with other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a table of students, we could use the student ID column as the primary key since each student has a unique ID. This would ensure that no two students have the same ID, and we could use this primary key to link data from other tables, such as a table of student grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key of another table. It is used to create a link or relationship between two tables. The foreign key constraint ensures that the data entered into the table is valid and consistent by only allowing data to be inserted into the foreign key column if it exists in the primary key column of the related table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a table of student grades, we could use the student ID column as a foreign key that references the primary key in the table of students. This would ensure that no student ID is entered into the grades table unless it already exists in the table of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, primary keys are unique identifiers that ensure data integrity, while foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables by linking them through the primary key of another table.\n",
